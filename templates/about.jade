			| We do this in two ways. 
			br
			br
			| First, we develop technologies for the <span class='about-callout'>analysis</span> and <span class='about-callout'>visualization</span> of data, and platforms for data sharing and <span class='about-callout'>reproducible</span> science. 
			br
			br
			| Second, we uncover principles of neural coding by helping design experiments that <span class='about-callout'>monitor</span> and <span class='about-callout'>manipulate</span> the nervous system while animals perform complex behaviors. 
			br
			br
			| We hope to understand how all animals sense, behave, and think â€” including mice, zebrafish, flies, and eventually, ourselves.
