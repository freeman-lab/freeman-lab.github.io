Welcome to the new Freeman lab site! This is the first of many posts about the science we do and the technology we develop. For now, I'll just say a little bit about this site itself.

<span class="more"></span>

I built it using [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), a fantastic static site generator built on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). I normally build sites from scratch, but we hope to use this blog to host a variety of content  from our group members and our collaborations, so I wanted something to manage blog-style content written in markdown, without imposing too much structure, and while maintaining tons of flexibility. Wintersmith is just that, and has been a lot of fun to use.

The design itself is from scratch, but has a few sources of inspiration. The visualization on the front page uses [D3](http://d3js.org/) and was a little exercise I gave myself to extend Mike Bostock's excellent [path transition](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/path/) example to multiple lines. The primary color scheme is a modified version of the one we use in [lightning](http://lightning-viz.org/). The fonts used are [Raleway](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway), [Cooperhewitt](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/open-source-at-cooper-hewitt/cooper-hewitt-the-typeface-by-chester-jenkins/), and [Roboto slab](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab).

I owe [Matt Conlen](https://twitter.com/mathisonian) a thank you because he taught me pretty much everything I know about node.js, and thanks to the rest of my group for critiquing the design. Sorry Andrew and Davis, the lines are staying black. Nick, you win.
